Description: An implementation of the stratification index proposed by Zhou (2012).
  The package provides two functions, srank, which returns stratum-specific
  information, including population share and average percentile rank; and strat,
  which returns the stratification index and its approximate standard error.
  When a grouping factor is specified, strat also provides a detailed decomposition
  of the overall stratification into between-group and within-group components.
